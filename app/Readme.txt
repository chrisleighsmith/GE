#Whats it all about 'Alfie' ?
This could be a great way to clean images that might have malware attached
of course I would never send any malware to any future employee unless I was feeling malicous

Or if I have intentions to use a complex social media exploit using 
1. Linkedin ( Fake profile to exploit new Companies HR processes and personal contact information + mine password for HR systems
2. Burner Mobile for contact with HR
3. Burner email for each Linkedin profile
4. Get all email contacts in company that might have AWS Admin access by using hubspot to phone home each time an email is opened by a tracker URL
5. Run Code to Attempt to login to AWS on any accounts ( from linkedin employees listing) that dont have MFA switched on
^^ see 4. (Surely admin will have 2FA switched on ?)
